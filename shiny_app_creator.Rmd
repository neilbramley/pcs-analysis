<!-- This repository contains a R Shiny app that helps to simplify the process of making final CogSci decisions. This assumes that CogSci is still using PCS, the reviews and meta-reviews are in (or coming in), and organizing committee chairs want to get started on making decisions. -->

<!-- Find the 2025 instance here: https://bramleyccslab.shinyapps.io/cogsci2025_submission_analysis/  -->

<!-- ## Why this app? -->

<!-- The *manual* way is via the PCS website. You login, and you can see every paper. But it's really difficult to *sort* the papers (And everytime you load the `Submissions` page it takes a while as its pulling and refreshing data). It's great for looking at individual papers (or if you have 1-6 papers), but it's horrendous when you have >1000 papers to go through. Moreover, as you are making your decisions, you have no way of keeping track of how many accepts you have had so far, as well as associated statistics (e.g., what is the mean scores of the "paper" decisions, etc). -->

<!-- Compared to the PCS interface, this app interface allows you to select specific papers, see the reviews, put in a decision, and then see how that decision updates the distribution of scores. There's a table that provides a running update on the numbers of talks, numbers of posters, etc. -->

<!-- You'll need one co-chair who's somewhat familiar with R / RStudio to launch/host it. -->

<!-- ## Basic setup -->

<!-- - RStudio has great support for Shiny. If you load the `.rmd` file in RStudio, you should have a "Run Document" button right at the top. -->
<!-- - The APP can be hosted on Shiny Apps https://shinyapps.io/ -->
<!--     - You can sign up for a free account, which allows up to 25 hours of app usage on the free tier. For CogSci2023 we used about 30+ hours, so I just signed up for the cheapest plan ($9/month). There might be a way to host this for free but *shrug* it wasn't too expensive. -->
<!--     - The great thing about hosting it on Shiny Apps is that any of the other co-chairs (even those unfamiliar with R) can access the app.  -->
<!--     - You need to run some code using rsconnect (code chunk below with instructions) to tell RStudio how to talk to your ShinyApps account. -->
<!-- - The DATA has to be stored in the cloud somewhere, as ShinyApps doesn't provide data storage.  -->
<!-- - To deploy the app, just hit "Run Document", then in the top-right of the window there'll be a "Publish" (or "Re-publish") button. Just hit that, select which account, **make sure to select the `.rmd` file and the `token.rds` file**, and boom, you're done!  -->

<!-- If any of the co-chairs wants to run this locally on their own computer (saving some compute hours on ShinyApp), just send them this `.rmd` file. They can just load this `.rmd` in RStudio and go. -->


<!-- ## Outline -->

<!-- - Once-off: Set up Shiny Apps (via the Shiny Apps website) -->
<!-- - Once-off: Set up Google Sheets -->
<!-- - Once-off/continuous: Get data from PCS (from two or more chairs, or one chair who has removed their conflicts) -->
<!-- 	- There are various data cleaning steps -->
<!-- - Continuous: Using the app to make and track decisions -->


<!-- ### Set up Shiny Apps -->

```{r shiny-apps-setup, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
## This chunk has one-off code for setting up ShinyApps
## When you set up your ShinyApps account on the website it will prompt you on how to set up your authentication. Basically, it'll look like the following:

#install.packages('rsconnect')
#
#rsconnect::setAccountInfo(name='  YOUR ACCOUNT NAME   ',
#			  token='  YOUR TOKEN  ',
#			  secret='  <SECRET>  ')
```


<!-- ### Getting the data -->

<!-- 1. Download Submissions From PCS:  -->
<!--     - `Chairing` -> `Submissions` (top left most link) -> [Wait for big table to load... "receiving data/rendering table"...] -> clear your search filters, if any, in the orange box in the top right -> click on the `Download` button on top right. The file should be named `Submissions.csv` by default. -->
<!--     - **Note** that there seems to be an alternative way to download submissions, which is `Chairing` -> `Downloadable Spreadsheets` heading -> (as csv) `Submissions` option. This file (by default named `cogsci25a_submission.csv` or whatever your cogsci year is named) does **NOT** give enough data to proceed. -->
<!--     - Run the code in the following chunk to create the initial `working_file.csv`. -->
<!-- 2. Download Reviews From PCS:  -->
<!--     - `Chairing` -> `Downloadable Spreadsheets` -> (as csv) `Reviews` -->
<!--     - The default name should be something like `cogsci25a_reviews.csv` (modify for your cogsci year) -->
<!-- 3. Upload `working_file.csv` and the `cogsci25a_reviews.csv` to google sheets. -->


<!-- Note that this file you generate will not contain your conflicts (e.g., papers that are co-authored by you, your students, or your collaborators (the "pink highlighted" papers on PCS). Since you can't see them on PCS, it makes sense that PCS won't give you those files in the csv). So you will have to ask one of the other co-chairs who does not have the same conflicts as you to pull these files as well for you to merge. There's code below to help do this. The alternative is for one chair to manually remove all their conflicts so they can download everything by themselves. -->


<!-- The code chunk below has one-off code that the hosting chair would have to run locally on their machine, depending on what you need to achieve: -->

<!-- - Create Initial Working File -->
<!-- - Updating Working File (when more scores come in) -->
<!-- - Merge review/scores for conflicted paperIDs -->
<!-- - Updating Reviews -->
<!-- - Prepare file to upload to PCS -->

Instructions for use:

- Click the decile you want to look at
- Click the paperID
- Scroll, read the reviews
- Use the Decision dropdown menu to change the decision.


### !!! Remember to save by hitting "Write to file!" !!!

You need to click "Write to file" to send the file up to Dropbox! It's not auto-saved.

Also make sure that **only one person** is working on the app at any one time, otherwise you might overwrite each other's changes.
